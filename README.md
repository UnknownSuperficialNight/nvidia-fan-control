# nvidia-fan-control
nvidia fan control utility wayland compatible

explanation:
i think the title says it all it manages ur gpu fan speed

it has a pre-built fan curve that it will adjust to so u done need to do anything its full automatic just execute with

sudo ./nvidia-rust

i have it set to autostart with my distro

disclaimer:
im using propriatary nvidia driver it may work with nouveau but ive never tried

to reset to default fan speed a restart should do the trick incase you dont like the program

uninstall:
just remove the binary and restart your pc
